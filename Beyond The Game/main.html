    <p style="font-size: 24px; text-align:justify">This project is focused on my college's baseball team, Texas A&M University, in comparison to the rest of the Southeastern Conference.
        In order to be the best, you must compare yourself to the rest and find where you stand in order to improve. I compiled the data of five of the best pitchers at Texas A&M 
        and I lined them up against the best pitcher of each team in their conference in terms of Strikeouts per Inning. The graphic shows that those that have the highest K/inning 
        and lowest WHIP (walks and hits per inning) are the most successful. Take for example, Asa Lacy (far left), who is one of the most dominating pitchers in baseball is a First-Team 
        All American and was drafted fourth overall for nearly seven million dollars.

    <p style="font-size: 24px, text-align:justify">This is my very first analytical project focusing on the correlation between curveball spin rate and movement for right-handed pitchers.
    Spin rate is not the only factor that impacts movement, but it is a strong contributor to the forces acting on a baseball as it reaches the strikezone.
    One of the main goals as a pitcher is to not let your opponent hit the baseball so it is crucial to optimize vertical and horizontal movement to consistently produce on the mound.
